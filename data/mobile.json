        "description": "The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 is priced way lower than the Galaxy Z Fold 3, but it's still an expensive phone and sits in proper flagship territory. The big design change is the new dual-tone look and the larger outer display or cover screen. The main 6.7-inch display is a Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel with the same resolution as the previous model, only now it has a 120Hz maximum refresh rate.The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC. Some of the OneUI software tricks that we saw on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 have been modified for the Galaxy Z Flip 3. The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is definitely more manageable than the Galaxy Z Fold 3 in your hand. Games look and run great on this phone. If you give the sensors adequate light, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 can capture good details and colours.",

        "description": "The Oppo Reno 6 shares a lot of features with the Pro model, such as the Bokeh Flare Portrait filter in the camera app, 65W fast charging, and a high refresh rate AMOLED display. The design gives off strong iPhone 12 vibes, but it really seems to work in its favour. The 6.42-inch AMOLED display looks very good. It has a full-HD+ resolution, Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 90Hz refresh rate, and a claimed peak brightness rating of up to 700nits.Oppo says this is India's first phone to sport the MediaTek Dimensity 900 SoC which is plenty powerful to handle daily tasks and games at the full-HD+ resolution. The 4,300mAh battery capacity might not sound too impressive, but with day-to-day usage, I was easily averaging more than a full day on single charge. The Oppo Reno 6 misses out on the rear depth camera that the Reno 6 Pro has, but apart from this, it has the same set of sensors on the front and back.",

Apple has returned to a flat aluminium frame but the iPhone 12 promises to be more durable thanks to its Ceramic Shield material on the front and IP68 rating. You get the A14 Bionic SoC which makes everyday use extremely smooth and responsive, but the device does get a bit warm when stressed. Battery life is good, but not great, and you'll be able to get through a full day. The iPhone 12 is relatively light and easy to handle. iOS 14 has some new customisation options and privacy features.",
